## IMU Rotation Transformation

This code applies a rotation transformation to an IMU that is mounted at an arbitrary angle. Both the TF (Transform) and the IMU data itself are adjusted accordingly to reflect the correct orientation.

### Features

- Rotates the IMU frame to align with the desired reference frame.
- Applies the transformation not only to the TF but also to the raw IMU data.
- Ensures consistent orientation data output for further processing.
